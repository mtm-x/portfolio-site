		excerpt: "Selected as regional finalist in NXP's Artificial Intelligence in Mobility competition, competing in robotic treasure hunt challenges using ROS2, SLAM, and computer vision.",
		content: `I recently took part in NXP AIM 2025 (Artificial Intelligence in Mobility) and managed to reach the regional finals. Though I didn't win, just getting selected from all the participants felt pretty amazing.

AIM is basically a competition where engineering students get to work with AI and robotics for mobility applications. We had to build mobile robot prototypes using technologies like AI/ML, object recognition, sensors, computer vision, and obstacle avoidance.

The Challenge:
The main task was a robotic treasure hunt that tested both simulation and real-world robotics skills. Our robots had to navigate through complex environments, detect objects, avoid obstacles, and complete autonomous missions on their own.

What I worked with:
- ROS2 for the robot operating system and distributed robotics
- Gazebo for 3D robotics simulation
- Python for writing the main algorithms
- Foxglove for visualizing data and debugging
- Shell scripting for automation and system integration
- OpenCV for computer vision and image processing
- SLAM for simultaneous localization and mapping
- Nav2 for autonomous navigation

This experience really pushed my robotics and AI knowledge forward. Working with SLAM to map unknown environments and using Nav2 for autonomous navigation was tough but really rewarding. Getting to work with both simulation in Gazebo and real hardware gave me a much better understanding of how mobile robotics actually works.

Even though I didn't win the regional finals, I learned a ton about AI applications in mobility and it definitely strengthened my interest in robotics and autonomous systems.`,

C Programming - Completed :)
Just finished the C fundamentals section and got my certification. The low-level programming concepts are starting to click, which feels great. [View my certificate here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BJ3lXz0yCHVueuUFquB8Hi46MNUon50J/view?usp=sharing)

Currently working on:
- C Pointers - Getting into memory management and pointer arithmetic
- Python - Learning how to use it for embedded applications
- AArch64 Architecture - ARM 64-bit processor stuff
- FPGA Development - Hardware description and programmable logic

Having instructors from Google is pretty cool because they bring real industry perspective. The course builds up from basics to practical implementation, which works well for me.

The C certification was a good milestone. Now diving into pointers, which is where things get interesting. The combination of all these topics should give me a solid foundation for embedded projects.`,

The application targets WiFi access points and disrupts their normal operation. It taught me a lot about network protocols, wireless security, and how networks can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks.

Key features:
- Linux-based WiFi jamming functionality
- Simple command-line interface
- Network security research tool
- Educational purposes only

This project helped me understand the importance of network security and how to protect against such attacks. It's important to note this should only be used for educational purposes and on networks you own or have permission to test.`,

The Python version offers:
- Clean, readable code structure
- Easy to modify and extend
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Good for learning network programming concepts

Working with Python for network operations taught me about socket programming, packet manipulation, and how different programming languages handle low-level network operations differently than C++.

The shell script approach taught me:
- Advanced bash scripting techniques
- System administration concepts
- How to interact with network interfaces from command line
- Linux networking tools and utilities

It's fascinating how different tools can achieve similar results. The shell script version is probably the most lightweight of all my WiFi jammer implementations, requiring minimal dependencies and running efficiently on any Linux system.

This project improved my Linux system administration skills and deepened my understanding of how network tools work at the command line level.`,

The script uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to communicate with Android devices and remove unwanted system applications that can't normally be uninstalled through the regular interface.

Features implemented:
- Automated ADB command execution
- Safe app removal with backups
- Device detection and connection handling
- Batch processing of multiple apps
- User-friendly command line interface

This project taught me about Android's system architecture, ADB protocol, and how to build useful automation tools. It also reinforced my Python skills, especially working with subprocess management and command-line tools.

The script has been helpful for cleaning up personal devices and understanding how Android package management works under the hood.`,
